    "text": "Payments are a massive part of how the world works. But most engineers know very little about it.\n\nThat’s sad, because, as more and more of business happens online, there’s an increasing demand for payment applications that are scalable, and maintainable.\n\nBesides, Python is a great programming language to build payment applications!\n\nIt is very interoperable, has a thriving open source community, and even non-engineers can contribute significantly to software built with it. In payments, readability counts, too!\n\nIn this talk, we’re going to dive deep into how to build money software effectively. You’ll learn why Python and payments are a match made in heaven, and how to leverage the language to build your own payment applications, in-house, fast, and effectively.\n\nThat way, you’ll cut some intermediaries in the process, saving your company a lot of money. It is no wonder why software engineers that can build payment applications are in high demand, they can point to their code and say “that prints money”.\n\nThe outline of the talk is:\n\nShut Up And Take My Money - Python is the Perfect Payments Language (5min)\nData-classes, Composition and A Chain of Responsibility (5-10min)\nUnification, and the Anti-corruption Layer (5min)\nHand over Fist - Debugging Payment Applications (5min)\nOutro - Every Company is a Payments Company (<5min)\n"

    "text": "Python is a wonderful thing that takes all the complication of memory management away from us. We don’t have to worry about pre-allocating memory for our objects, or remember to free it once we’re done. So, given that we’re not doing it manually, how do these things happen? Do we have to care? Well, sometimes. Maybe.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll discuss what a pointer is, where they crop in in Python, and what you need to know in order to avoid getting tripped up by them. We’ll also cover the id of an object, why it's implemented the way it is, and why 'equal' is different from 'identical'. Finally, we’ll talk about garbage collection, what reference counting is, and how CPython knows when it’s time to get rid of unused objects.\n\nWhether you just want to understand what’s going on under the hood without having to dive into the implementation, or you’re on the hunt for some new diabolical things to do with code (self-referential lists are only the beginning!), come along to this talk and learn about the pointers in your Python.\n\nThis talk is aimed at anyone with an interest in how Python handles objects in memory, or who’s ever been confused by side-effects popping up in their code. Absolutely no knowledge of C is required, and Python beginners are extremely welcome."

    "text": "ELEVATOR PITCH\nI asked myself a question: “what happens when you import something in python?” The answer was not as simple as I thought. In this talk, I’ll share what I learnt, and discuss why this is vital for security, before sharing opinions on tooling, especially the use of the Poetry alternative PDM, in 2024.\n\nABSTRACT\nPython has a rich ecosystem of open source packages available to assist with almost any conceivable requirement. Installing, using, and updating these packages should be quick, easy, and secure, however, dependency management and python packaging has historically been a source of frustration for developers, particularly with the added complications of virtual environments, and subtle differences between python versions. Furthermore, software supply chain security has attracted particular importance of late as increasing numbers of major vulnerabilities have been discovered requiring fast, sometimes immediate, mitigation.\n\nIn recent years, efforts have been made to improve packaging and dependency management in python, and we have seen the release of a number of developer tools, including Poetry, pipenv, and pipx. These work alongside pip and earlier tools such as disutils, setuptools, and easy_install, and offer higher level interfaces for developers to work with. In 2020, a new tool was released called PDM (Python Dependency Manager), and is gaining traction amongst developers in recent years.\n\nThis talk will start by giving an overview of how python imports work, before moving on to cover a brief history of package management in python, and an overview of the current state of play, and the vulnerabilities that we are exposed to by supply chain attacks. We’ll then give a brief introduction to PDM, before discussing what practical steps we can take to both improve our developer experiences, and ensure the code we write is modern, secure, and maintainable.\n\nWe’ll ask questions including some of the below.\n\n* What actually happens ‘under the hood’ when we use the import statement?\n* How many different ways can we import a package in python?\n* What does a dependency manager do, and how does it work?\n* What does a supply chain attack look like, and how do we try and stop them happening?\n\nFinally, the speaker will offer an opinionated guide to some of the best python tooling and package management setups available to python developers in 2024."

Hydraulic modeling plays a pivotal role in understanding the performance of these roofs in retaining and managing water. This abstract delves into the utilization of Python, specifically leveraging the capabilities of NumPy and machine learning algorithms, to develop and analyze hydraulic models for green and purple roofs.\n\nThe integration of Python, a versatile programming language, with the scientific computing library NumPy, provides a powerful platform for constructing mathematical models that simulate water flow and retention characteristics of these innovative roofing systems. Through the application of machine learning algorithms, these models aim to predict and optimize the hydraulic behavior of green and purple roofs under varying conditions.\n\nIn this study, the focus lies in harnessing Python's computational prowess to implement numerical methods for simulating water flow dynamics on green and purple roofs. Utilizing NumPy's array-based computing functionalities enables efficient manipulation and calculation of large datasets, crucial for modeling complex hydraulic systems. By integrating machine learning techniques, such as regression and neural networks, with the hydraulic models, predictive capabilities are enhanced to forecast water retention, infiltration rates, and overall performance of these roofs.\n\nPython's extensibility allows for the incorporation of data collected from physical prototypes or real-world installations, facilitating the calibration and validation of the hydraulic models. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, these models adapt and improve over time with additional data, enhancing their accuracy and reliability in predicting water behavior on green and purple roofs.\n\nFurthermore, Python's visualization libraries enable the creation of graphical representations that aid in interpreting and communicating the simulation results. This visualization aspect is crucial for stakeholders, urban planners, and researchers to comprehend the hydraulic performance of green and purple roofs, fostering informed decision-making regarding their implementation and optimization.\n\nThrough the amalgamation of Python, NumPy, and machine learning techniques, this study aims to contribute to the advancement of hydraulic modeling for green and purple roofs. By harnessing the computational capabilities of Python and leveraging machine learning algorithms, the goal is to develop robust and predictive models that assist in optimizing the design, performance evaluation, and implementation of these sustainable roofing systems in urban environments.\n\nKeywords: Hydraulic modeling, Green roof, Purple roof, Python, NumPy, Machine learning, Water retention, Stormwater management, Urban sustainability."

This presentation aims to demystify the concept of LOF and equip attendees with the knowledge to effectively identify and interpret local outliers in their own datasets.\n\nThe talk will commence with a brief overview of the theoretical underpinnings of LOF, shedding light on its ability to detect anomalies by comparing the local density of data points. We will explore the nuances of LOF, emphasizing its capacity to capture anomalies that might be overlooked by traditional methods.\nWe'll provide an overview of the steps involved and share practical insights into integrating LOF into data analysis workflows.\n\nThe talk will conclude by outlining considerations for parameter tuning and interpreting LOF results, providing attendees with a foundational understanding of how to apply LOF effectively in their data exploration endeavors.\n\n\nBy the end of the talk, attendees will have a solid understanding of the basics of LOF, its significance in anomaly detection, and the proficiency to apply this algorithm in Python. Whether you are a beginner seeking an introduction to outlier detection or an experienced practitioner looking to enhance your toolkit, this presentation promises to be a valuable exploration into the realm of local outlier factors."

    "text": "In this workshop, we will learn how to gain insight into a dataset. We will use a dataset that everyone can relate to - Pokemon! This workshop will be entirely practical - you will code along with us in a Jupyter notebook. We will be explaining the theory and rationale behind what code we write along the way, and the audience are encouraged to ask questions along the way.\n\nWe will simulate the job of a real-world data analyst who is tasked with investigating a question: Does higher health correlate with a better attack?\n\nTo accomplish this, we will progress through the dataset from basic cleanup all the way to fitting a machine learning model. We will first clean and filter the dataset, and determine if the data is even usable. Here, we will learn how to evaluate the quality of the data (summary statistics, missing values and what to do with them (imputation), data distribution etc). We will look into the HP and Attack data and ascertain if what we’re given is sufficient to answer our question. Can we add another feature to these two? We’ll also look at additional feature selection.\n\nWe will then progress to data visualization - we’ll touch on which plot to use for which purpose and learn their syntax in Python (Histogram, scatter plot, correlation plot, box and whisker plot + violin plot, hist and rug plot). We will visualize the data in multiple ways.\n\nConcluding the workshop, we will move on to simple machine learning - you will be introduced to supervised learning, classification and regression. We will discuss how to choose the right model to train and look at applying regression models (linear regression) and classification models (logistic regression, random forest) to our dataset. We will measure the performance of these models, and draw conclusions from their outputs.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, we will answer the initial question, as well as gain insights into the Pokemon dataset, realising how powerful Python is in accessible data analysis."

Let's find out together!\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn about MLOps and take your first steps in a hands-on way. To do so, we will be using **Open Source** tooling. We will be taking a simple example of Machine Learning use case and will gradually make it more ready for production \uD83D\uDE80.\n\nWe start with a simple time-series model in Python using scikit-learn and first add logging steps to make the performance of the model measurable. Don't worry: we will go through it step-by-step, so you won't be overwhelmed. Then, we will log our ML model and load it back into an inference step. Lastly, we will learn about deploying these actual models by Dockerizing our application \uD83D\uDE4F."

Lepšie raz vidieť, ako veľa ráz počuť, preto budeme kresliť čo sa dá, aj čo veľmi nie :-) Pomôže nám pritom plotly. Aby sme sa len my sami netešili, urobíme nakoniec webovú aplikáciu (pyviz panel), ktorú si môžu pozrieť aj iní.

    "text": "Všimli ste si, ako často recruiteri nerozumejú IT? Nevedia vám poriadne vysvetliť, akú pracovnú pozíciu ponúkajú, spätná väzba po pohovore sa postupne stáva sci-fi fenoménom a keď už sa vám konečne podarí získať nový projekt, mnohí z vás zaň nedostanú ani férové finančné ohodnotenie? Alebo vám klienti dokonca nezaplatia včas?\n\nPred takmer jedenástimi rokmi sa dvaja ostrieľaní ajťáci rozhodli vydláždiť pre IT špecialistov novú cestu, ktorá by sa odlišovala osobným a odborne fundovaným prístupom. Tú si do dnešného dňa zvolilo viac ako 29-tisíc freelancerov, od konzultantov cez programátorov, testerov, analytikov až po manažérov, ktorí získavajú špičkové projekty. Dá sa povedať, že značka TITANS ovládla trh outsourcingu IT špecialistov na Slovensku. \n\nPrieskumy uvádzajú, že IT oddelenia rozširuje čoraz menej úspešných firiem. Efektívnejší je pre ne dynamický prenájom tímu. Predstavím vám dôvody, pre ktoré toľkí ajťáci prechádzajú na breh freelancingu a faktory, ktoré vám pomôžu zistiť, či je to pre vás vhodná cesta. Dozviete sa viac o vývoji trhu, odvetviach s najväčším množstvom projektov, finančnom ohodnotení a tiež o špecializáciách, ktoré sú najžiadanejšie na IT projektoch. Na záver vám priblížim rozličné formy spolupráce s klientmi, priemerný čas, ktorí naši Titani strávia na projektoch, a praktický rozdiel medzi živnosťou a sro-čkou."
